## Project Overview
This is the third JavaScript assignment focusing on creating a Bookmarker application implementing CRUD operations.

## Demo Reference
Reference Implementation: [Bookmarker Demo](https://bit.ly/3NOr9nD)

## Core Requirements
1. Create a web application that matches or improves upon the design of the reference implementation
2. Implement functionality to add, display, and delete website bookmarks
3. Include URL validation to ensure only valid URLs can be added

## Technical Guidelines
### Core Functionality
- Create input fields for Bookmark Name and Website URL
- Implement an "Add" button to save new bookmarks
- Display saved bookmarks in a table format
- Include "Visit" button that redirects to the bookmarked website
- Include "Delete" button to remove bookmarks from the list
- Implement URL validation to ensure only valid URLs can be submitted

### Technical Hints

2. **CRUD Operations**
   - Create: Add new bookmarks
   - Read: Display bookmarks in the table
   - Delete: Remove bookmarks from the list
  
## Notes
- Focus on clean code implementation
- Ensure smooth user experience
- Test thoroughly for edge cases
